This is where Iâ€™ll be constantly posting about topics which interest me. This is a way to ensure that I keep learning, and my favorite way to learn is to explain.

If you want to learn about something in specific, this is not the blog for you. This is simply a record of my own learning experience. Not all articles are meant to be read and understood with no initial knowledge of the topic ([this article]({% post_url 2022-06-14-networking-fundamentals %}) came to mind). That said, anyone is welcome to wander around and see if anything interests them.
