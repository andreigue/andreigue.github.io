This blog is a personal thinking space. I use writing to slow ideas down, examine assumptions, and understand what I actually believe. Most of what’s written here is not meant to persuade or perform certainty, but to clarify my own thinking.

Ideas are allowed to change, mature, or be discarded entirely.

This blog is shared publicly, but it exists primarily for me.
