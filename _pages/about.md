I'm a third year software engineering student, seeking an internship for Summer 2020. The ideal internship for me would be any technical position, as I am at a point in my learning journey where I just want to learn anything and everything about software. 

Feel free to check out my projects, check out my blog posts, contact me, stalk me, I don't care. Do whatever you want, just don't DDoS me or something.
