I am a recent graduate of McGill University with a Bachelors in Software Engineering, seeking for employment in the field of cyebr security. The ideal position for me would be any entry-level technical position within the field, as I am at a point in my learning journey where I just want to learn anything and everything about the field. I simply want to get my feet wet.

Feel free to check out my blog posts, contact me, stalk me... ok don't stalk, that's weird.
