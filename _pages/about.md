I am a recent graduate of McGill University with a Bachelors in Software Engineering, currently working at [KidCoder.ca](https://kidcoder.ca/), an online school teaching novice programmers (predominantly kids) the Python programming language through Minecraft. Because of it's part-time nature, I am still open to a position in the IT/programming field. The ideal position for me would be any entry-level technical position within the field of cybersecurity, as I am at a point in my learning journey where I just want to learn anything and everything about the field. I simply want to get my feet wet.

Feel free to check out my blog posts, contact me, stalk me... ok don't stalk, that's weird. And no DDoS attacks please.
