title: "Introduction to Terminals: Part 1"

#### _This is a first article in a series where we explain to you what is a terminal and how you can use it to awaken the coder inside of you and speed up your day-to-day life._

----------------------------

If you happen to find yourself around programmers or hackers one day, it is very possible that you may hear one of the following terms: "terminal", "command line", or "CLI" (short for "Command Line Interface"). As it turns out, all these terms mean the same thing. However, that latter term gives some more information about what a "terminal" actually is: an interface.

Now, what is an interface? An interface is simply a program, or a "view" of a computer, allowing a user (you, me, and everyone else using computers) to interact with that computer. This "view" can come in various flavors. For example, I have a Windows device, i.e. my laptop runs the Windows Operating System (OS). Windows has a very easy to use interface (their programmers work hard to make it easy to use so that more people will buy their OS). Consequently, when most people use a computer, they use what's known as a Graphical User Interface (GUI). The GUI is made up of windows, icons, and menus that allow you to interact with the computer by clicking and dragging things on the screen. It does not get any more intuitive than seeing a red "X" button on the top right corner of your browser, and using it to close that windows. Just what the average, non-technical, computer-user needs.

Then we have the computer enthusiasts. Instead of just using their computers simply for basic tasks like checking email, these people take it to the next level. They write code. They automate tedious tasks. They hack into their OS to make it more efficient. They themselves are more efficient with the computer. How?

As it turns out, using the GUI is not the most efficient way of doing things sometimes. Sure, double clicking on an icon on your Desktop is easy, but
