# Summary

"Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System", written by Satoshi Nakamoto, describes a peer-to-peer electronic payment system that is decentralized and enables financial transfers without the middleman (aka "the bank"). It was a revolutionary idea back when it was first published in 2008, in the midst of the financial crisis and just a month after the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers (perfect timing considering that trust in traditional financial institutions was at an all-time low).

Simply put, the blockchain is a record-keeping mechanism.
