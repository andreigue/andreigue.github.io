title: "The Bitcoin Whitepaper: My Initial Thoughts"

#### _This is the fifth article in a series where my goal is to understand the blockchain, NFTS, and the related technologies._

Before we move any further on **facts**, I wanted to share some of my **thoughts**/concerns so far about the blockchain and Bitcoin, based on my current understanding of it.

----------------------------

From my understanding (not just by reading the whitepaper), Bitcoin is a digital asset used as a store of value. Similar to gold, but without any industry applications like jewelry... and it's much more divisible. And portable. And hideable.

It's value comes from the fact that there are other people who would buy it. If the price goes down to 20k, there will be people who will think "that's a steal". If the value goes up to 60k, there will be people who will start to sell. Maybe in a near-distance future, the price range won't be 40k, but will start to settle down. But who knows. Because honestly, how do we put a number on this protocol? A bitcoin is definitely worth something, but to put an exact number on it makes no sense. While we can read a company's balance sheet, expected sales, etc. and deduct an approximate valuation, it's a bit harder to put a number on transaction rules which are enforced by thousands of nodes around the world, all using up electrical power in order to sustain the system full of strangers whom they've never met before. It's truly a beautiful invention.

In some sense its price could simply keep going up due to its (slightly) deflationary nature. However, that assumes that interest levels stay constant, or better yet, rise, among the general population. And that's not too hard to see happen. Since once you get Bitcoin, you can't "un-get" it. Once you see the beauty of it, you can't unsee it. The true fan club (and not those people in it to make a quick buck) can only grow (this growth can be stunted by external factors such as governmental regulations, as mentioned in the next paragraph).

However, despite all this positive talk, and despite me thinking that Bitcoin is a beautiful creation, I think that a big part of Bitcoin's and other cryptocurrencies price appreciation is due to hype and people trying to make a quick profit, RATHER THAN being tied to a fundamental demand for the underlying technology. It's really dependant on very superficial factors such as media coverage, celebrity endorsements, overall economic conditions, and government regulation; the first three having a more short-term effect, and the latter having a stronger impact on the value of Bitcoin I'd argue (if the government makes it illegal to transact in bitcoin tomorrow, I doubt many people will dabble in it).

I also don't buy Satoshi's big idea that middlemen are all that bad. He made a big deal about how "a seller can get scammed by a buyer if the seller sends the product and the buyer disputes the purchase with the bank leaving the seller without the item and without the money". I'm not saying they're perfect, but I'd argue that most people would like to have an assurance that IF they forget their password to their account, they can recover it, IF they mispell the email address for an e-transfer, the bank can cancel the transaction. And sometimes, you just need to sue the person you are transacting with. As a law-abiding citizen, you would prefer to live in a country where the law is applicable at all times. Such a regulatory environment cannot have roots within a blockchain. Governments and centralized authorities will always have a place in our world. (I guess this is not an attack on Bitcoin per se anymore, it's more about the idea that blockchain technology does have it's limitations in use cases).

And just a few words about the blockchain: while blockchain technology offers many benefits, it is important to recognize its limitations when it comes to storing sensitive information. While the transactions on the Bitcoin network may seem "random" and hidden,  they are pseudonymous, meaning that the identity of the users behind the transactions is not directly revealed, but can be deducted. 

If the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica scandal taught us anything, it's that ordinary civilians are uncomfortable and frustrated with how their personal data is shared left and right without their consent. People clearly value privacy and control over their data.

If we expand blockchain's reach into other aspects of our lives, then anyone would be able to read/estimate how much money we have, where we visit, who we chat with, which airlines we use, which movies we watch, so on and so forth. Would you rather Netflix see and analyze your watch pattern, feed the data into their AI tools and show you new movie recommendations, or would you rather have anyone with access to the blockchain see which movie you watched yesterday? Because at the end of the day, everything you do on the blockchain leaves a permanent mark and can be traced back to you.
