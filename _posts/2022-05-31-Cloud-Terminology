What is the general definition of cloud?

Amazon's AWS basic definition is spot on: "Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the Internet with pay-as-you-go pricing. Instead of buying, owning, and maintaining physical data centers and servers, you can access technology services, such as computing power, storage, and databases, on an as-needed basis from a cloud provider like Amazon Web Services (AWS)." [1] 
Now of course AWS (33% market share) conveniently forgot to mention its competitors: Microsoft Azure (21% share), Google Cloud (10% share), Alibaba Cloud (6% share), IBM Cloud (4% share), Salesforce Cloud offerings (3% share), Tencent Cloud (3% share) and Oracle Cloud (2% share). 
These are huge companies, and they can afford to spend billions on procuring entire data centers and physical servers. This translates into savings for the customers thanks to the economies of scale. Customers don't typically  know or care about the exact physical location of those resources, but the important thing is that the servers used for the task are spread in multiple locations, which improves reliability and reduces latency for end users (if any).

Why cloud?

To better understand why, it helps to see how we got here. In th 1990's, large companies would have rooms in their business solely for the purpose of storing data. Hence, the entire data center belongs to the company. The company has entire control over their data center; it's their servers, their databases, their routers, switches and firewalls. All of this is theirs, because they bought them. Now the question is, why didn't all companies just build their own centers, and buy their own equipment? 

The answer is cost. Have a look for yourself at [the price of server racks](https://www.cdw.com/search/servers-server-management/servers/rack-servers/?w=SB2). 



It is important to note that buying your own equipment is not cheap. 
As more tech companies started to emerge during the dot-com boom, and as more and more data started to appear, companies resorted to co-location.   


There are three main types of cloud computing: IaaS, PaaS and SaaS. They differ in the amount of control given to the customer. 
IaaS provides access to networking capabilities, storage, and ultimately, computers (whether it be virtual or physical hardware). PaaS on the other hand, provides an environment which the application needs. This allows the customer to focus more on the application logic, rather than meddling around with the hardware and OS details. Hence, PaaS allows customers to concentrate more on their business goals, and spend less money on creating and maintaining their technical infrastructure. Finally, SaaS provides all the possible services: from the low level networking/server configurations, to the OS and runtime configurations, to the application layer and its data. SaaS applications are those which are hosted on the cloud, and they are consumed directly over the internet by end users. Well-known SaaS applications include Gmail, Google Drive, Google Docs,
