## Chapter 1. The Power of Markets

### Decentralized Order

It's incredible how markets function: the sum of a bunch of self-interested (i.e. selfish) parties forms a fully functioning society. There is nothing wrong with being selfish [(Note 1)](#1), as it is selfishness that has led us to civilization. People act to make themselves better off (in theory), and while doing so, they end up making other people better off as well.

This chapter is based on this rhetorical question: Who feeds Paris? Somehow, the stores and restaurants in Paris get the exact amount of food and ingredients that they need in order to feed its citizens (ignoring all the food waste for a moment). The fish you were served at the local restaurant was caught in the Pacific Ocean by a company called Tokyo Seafood Inc. It was then sold to Global Fish Distributors, who transported it by air to Paris. Upon arrival, the fish was delivered to a local wholesaler, from whom the restaurant purchased it and prepared it for your meal. This seamless supply chain ensures Paris is always well-fed.

This process works because of the (decentralized) market system, where each person, from fishermen to wholesalers, acts in their own best interest but ends up helping everyone. Fishermen sell their catch for the best price (not too high, not too low), distributors and transporters handle logistics to make a profit, and wholesalers manage stock to meet demand. Prices act as signals, indicating scarcity or abundance, and guiding decisions on where resources are needed most. No central planner trying to micromanage and orchestrate the entire dance. Just clean, decentralized and individualized decision-making, driven by incentives and coordinated by prices.

But as we all know, humans aren't perfect. Some of us lack the self-discipline to do things that we know will make us better off in the long run. So it is not unreasonable for society to help individuals do things which they otherwise would not or could not do. This is where the government and public policy come in.

### Quotes from Ch.1

"I will argue that a market economy is to economics what democracy is to government: a decent, if flawed, choice among many bad alternatives. Markets are consistent with our views of individual liberty. We may disagree over whether or not the government should compel us to wear motorcycle helmets, but most of us agree that the state should not tell us where to live, what to do for a living, or how to spend our money. True, there is no way to rationalize spending money on a birthday cake for my dog when the same money could have vaccinated several African children. But any system that forces me to spend money on vaccines instead of doggy birthday cakes can only be held together by oppression. The communist governments of the twentieth century controlled their economies by controlling their citizens' lives. They often wrecked both in the process. During the twentieth century, communist governments killed some 100 million of their own people in peacetime, either by repression or by famine." [(Note 2)](2)

"[We] can and should use the government to modify market in all kinds of ways. The economics battle of the twentieth century was between capitalism and communism. Capitalism won. [...] The economic battles of the twenty-first century will be over how unfettered our markets should be."

## Chapter 2. Incentives Matter

### Science of Unintended Consequences

One of my favorite chapters for sure. So eye-opening on the unintended consequences of setting up a policy.

Consider the well-meaning idea to require car seats for infants and small children on planes, even though you can currently fly with a "lap child" without buying an extra seat. During the Clinton administration, the FAA pushed for this, arguing that children should have the same protection as adults in case of an accident. It seems logical: car seats could save lives in a "rough landing" situation.

But here's the problem: buying an extra plane seat for the car seat makes flying much more expensive (you are essentially forced to buy an extra plane seat for your little one), so some families might choose to drive instead. The catch? Driving, even with a car seat, is far more dangerous than flying. So, ironically, this rule could lead to more injuries and deaths, not fewer.

Mexico City, one of the most polluted cities in the world, tried to cut down on pollution in 1989 by requiring cars to stay off the streets one day a week, based on their license plate numbers. The logic was simple: fewer cars, less pollution.

But here's the problem: people who didn’t want the inconvenience just bought extra cars or kept their old ones when buying new ones. The result? More old, dirty cars on the road, making the air quality even worse.

These examples highlight a key lesson: policies that seem beneficial on the surface can sometimes have hidden costs that outweigh their intended benefits.

This isn't to say good policy doesn't exist. London addressed traffic congestion by charging an $8 USD fee for driving in central city areas during rush hour, starting in 2003. Over time, they raised the fee and expanded the coverage area.

This policy leverages a basic market principle: raising prices reduces demand. The result? Fewer cars on the road, reduced traffic, increased use of public transit, and faster-moving buses due to less congestion.

### Misaligned Incentives in the Corporate World

The private sector has its troubles as well, both at the lowest and highest levels.

On the low end, take a cashier working at Burger King. The cashier might have incentives that don't align with the company’s best interests. It's in the cashier's interest to steal money, perhaps by selling you a meal without recording the transaction and pocketing the cash. Burger King could spend significant resources monitoring its employees for theft, or it could offer an incentive for customers to do the job by putting up a sign that reads "Your meal is free if you don't get a receipt. Please see a manager".

At the higher end of corporate America, consider CEOs. If I own stock in a company, how can I be sure the CEO is acting in my best interest? For instance, two-thirds of corporate mergers don't add value to the firms involved, and some even harm shareholders. So why do CEOs pursue these often questionable deals? Because it benefits them; bigger companies mean more prestige, higher salaries, and larger perks like private jets. To align their incentives with shareholder interests, companies often pay CEOs in stock options: if the company’s stock does well, they do well too. But this isn’t a perfect solution, as it can drive CEOs to seek short-term gains at the expense of long-term stability. Studies show that firms with large options grants are more prone to accounting fraud and debt defaults.

Finally, let's come back to earth and look at an example of misaligned incentives in our lives: real estate agents. Both from the buy and the sell side. 

On the buy side, you're looking for a house and want to negotiate the price down. But your agent, who earns a percentage of the purchase price, benefits from a higher price and a quicker sale. Your interests are completely opposite. [(Note 3)](#3)

On the sell side, it seems like your incentives are aligned with your agent’s: both of you want to sell for as much as possible. But consider this: if you’re selling a $300,000 house, your agent could list it at $280,000 and sell it quickly, or list it at $320,000 and wait for a higher offer. The extra $40,000 means a lot to you, but to your agent, it’s only an additional $1,200 after weeks of extra work, extra showings, extra open houses. If I were the agent, I’d sell it quick and move on to the next deal.

### Not All Taxes Are Created Equal

The topic of incentives also touches the world of taxes. You can't just say "tax the rich" and expect them to sit still. The rich aren't static; they adapt. They change their behavior to avoid as much taxation as possible. Take Bjorn Borg, for example. He became wealthy playing tennis, and the Swedish government taxed him heavily. Borg simply moved to Monaco, and Sweden ended up collecting nothing from him.

If the government imposes a heavy tax on red sports cars, most people will just stop buying red cars. The result? The government collects no revenue, and car enthusiasts miss out on driving their favorite red sports cars. This phenomenon, where taxes make individuals worse off without benefiting anyone else, is known as "deadweight loss".

In general, it's better to have a broad tax. It's harder to evade since fewer activities are exempt, and the tax rate can be lower because it's spread across more people. This way, there's less incentive to dodge it. But even with broad taxes, you have to be careful: if everyone pays the same tax, it hits the poor harder because it takes up a larger portion of their income. This kind of tax is called a regressive tax.

### Quotes from Ch.2

Capitalism can be a brutal, cruel process. We look back and speak admiringly of technological breakthroughs like the steam engine, the spinning wheel, and the telephone. But those advances made it a bad time to be, respectively, a blacksmith, a seamstress, or a telegraph operator. Creative destruction is not just something that might happen in a market economy. It is something that must happen. At the beginning of the twentieth century, half of all Americans worked in farming or ranching. Now that figure is about one in a hundred and still falling. [...] Note that two important things have not happened: (1) We have not starved to death; and (2) we do not have a 49 percent unemployment rate. Instead, American farmers have become so productive that we need far fewer of them to feed ourselves. The individuals who would have been farming ninety years ago are now fixing our cars, designing computer games, playing professional football, etc. Just imagine our collective loss of utility if Steve Jobs, Steven Spielberg, and Oprah Winfrey were corn farmers.

Creative destruction is a tremendous positive force in the long run. THe bad news is that people don't pay their bills in the long run."

"During the Industrial Revolution, weavers in rural England demonstrated, petitioned Parliament, and even burned down textile mills in an effort to fend off mechanization. Would we be better off now if they had succeeded and we still made all of our clothes by hand?"

## Chapter 3: Government and the Economy

### Negative Externalities

The problem with the free market is that if you let it roam free, it will destroy the planet. Why? **Negative externalities: those cases in which individuals or companies engage in private actions that have harmful consequences for society at large.**

Consider this scenario: A large agricultural company produces a pesticide that seeps into local water supplies, poisoning families. There’s no market solution here; **the market itself is the problem**. The company maximizes profits by selling a product that causes cancer in innocent victims. Meanwhile, farmers who are unaware of (or indifferent to) the pollution will actually reward the company by buying more of its cheaper, more effective product, further incentivizing the harmful behavior. Competitors who invest in making safer, non-toxic alternatives might lose out because their products are more expensive. **This is where the government must step in, regulating or banning such harmful practices to protect public health.**

But not all externalities require government intervention. Take, for example, small children on airplanes. They scream, kick the seat in front of them, and generally make the flight less enjoyable for everyone around them. Imagine being stuck on a 12-hour flight with a 5-year-old directly behind you and a 1-year-old beside you. Even if the ticket was free, you'd probably hesitate to take that seat. Here, parents don’t bear the full cost of traveling with their young ones; other passengers do.

So why doesn’t the government need to step in here? Because this is a problem the airline itself can address. It’s a manageable issue involving a relatively small group of people. For instance, airlines could designate seating for families with children under 5 in the back of the plane, grouping them together. They could also offer noise-cancelling headphones to other passengers during the flight. The key point is that government intervention isn't necessary when companies can implement practical solutions on their own, and whenever possible, it’s better to let them handle it.

### Positive Externality

There exist also positive externalities: situations in which a behavior benefits others, but the individual is not compensated any extra for this. For example, if  

### Property Rights

Another place where the government smoothens the rough edges of a free market are property and intellectual rights / copyright laws (form of proprerty right).  

That's why Napster got sued  the company encountered legal difficulties over copyright infringement. First Metallica, and then Dr Dre filed a lawsuit. Napster's facilitation of the transfer of copyrighted material. [expand a bit]

This book was written in 2013, and back then, Pfizer had a patent on Viagra, which A lot of people will complain that a pill of Viagra costs $7 to buy, yet costs pennies to produce. Pfizer had a patent , guaranteed by the government, that nobody can just copy their formula. Why not? Why not let everyone compete and study what the other companies make in order to try to improve on it and create competition and eventually lower the prices while providing the best product possible? Well without such protection, companies would not spend the hundreds of millions of dollars on R&D it takes to bring a new drug to market. Pfizer would lose on its investment.
If you couldnt protect a product that you spent years trying to develop and spent hundreds of millions of dollars, then why would anyone scour the world's rain forest for exotic tree barks with medical properties?

### Regulations

Feeding off from the previous section, governments create rules and regulations which lowers the cost of doing business in the private sector. They enforce contracts, root out fraud, circulate sound currency. SEC, FAA, FDA, FBI, IRS, INS, US patent office, etc. [expand]

### Free-Rider Problem

Governments provide "public goods", that make us better off but would not otherwise be provided by the private sector.

Suppose i decide I want to buy an antimissile system to protect myself from missiles from a belligerant neighboring country. I ask my neighbors if they want to pitch in. Most say no, because they have a strong incentive to be "Free riders", because if the system is built, they will benefit from it for free. In the end, the system does not get built, even though it might have made us all better off if we all pitched in.

A private company cannot force consumers to pay for these kinds of goods, no matter how much utility they may derive from them or how often they will use them. THink of a lighthouse, a park, a radio signal, research in the Higgs Boson, law enforcement. 

This of law enforcement. Sure, you can hire a personal bodyguard, but he will only defend you if someone trespasses. What about people who may trespass in the future? Who is proactively tracing the gangs with a perpetrator who may eventually attack someone. Counterterorrism

### Stop Blaming the Government for Everything

Government redistributs wealth. We collect taxes from some citizens and provide benefits to others. Contrary to popular opinion, most government benefits do not go to the poor; they go to the midle class in the form of Medicare and SOcial Security. Who is to say how much the government should tax, and how much to give it to who?

For example, which of these two scenarios is better for the overall state of the country: if every person earnend $25000, enough to cover the basic necessities, or the status quo, in which some Americans are wildly rich, some are despearetly poor, and the average income is somewhere around 48000? The latter describes a bigger economic pie, the former is a smaller pie more evenly divided. 

Economics does not provide the tools for answering  philosophical questions related to income distribution. For example, economists cannot prove that takinga  dollar 
Not everything is science. There isn't allways just one right and clear answer. As a simple example,

## Notes

#### 1

By selfish, I mean we all seek our own happiness, and the path we take varies for each of us. Some people might be happy by purchasing a new car, while others are happier when they help someone cross the street, or volunteer somewhere. The latter have value as well, even if not monetary. This is the concept of utility in economics: the total satisfaction or benefit derived from consuming a good or service.

The only good argument I've heard thus far in defense of communism is external influence from capitalist countries. I mean, the CIA went nuts shortly after its creation in 1947. Iran 1953, Guatemala 1954, Congo 1960, Cuba 1961. Bribing politicians, funding protests, funding labor movements to undermine governments. Setting up a fake radio station pretending to be coming from that country, broadcasting false reports of uprisings and protests (this happened in Guatemala). Providing equipment and training to exiles and rebel groups. These are the lengths to which the U.S. and its allies went to ensure that communism didn’t gain a foothold in those countries.

Now, I'm not saying the U.S. didn't do what was necessary for its interests; they did what they believed was essential to maintain their position as the world’s superpower. If it's the middle of the Cold War and you know that Congo has rich deposits of Uranium, you’re going to make sure it stays out of communist hands [(video explaining the Congo situation)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSyEnnGR4ec). The stakes were global, and they played the game accordingly, pulling whatever strings necessary to tilt the balance of power in their favor. I love [this video as well detailing the meddling of Chile and Nicaragua](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwyjlmEAcYM).

I'm not saying the USSR didn't engage in the same interferences, but it's hard to determine the effectiveness of a system if the world's superpower keeps meddling in your business.

This is the case when you're a first-time buyer, not an investor. If you’re an investor and your real estate agent knows you’ll be buying and selling properties throughout your life, then their incentives align with yours. It’s in their best interest to look out for you because they know you’ll be a repeat customer. That’s when a partnership forms; one where your success becomes their success too. In the long run, this kind of relationship is what will make the agent the most money.
