## Chapter 1. The Power of Markets

It's incredible how markets function: the sum of a bunch of self-interested (i.e. selfish) parties forms a fully functioning society. There is nothing wrong with being selfish [(1)](#1), as it selfishness that has led us to civilization (keep reading to understand). People act to make themselves better off (in theory), and while doing so, they end up making other people better off as well.

Consider the rhetorical question: Who feeds Paris? Somehow, the stores and restaurants in Paris get the exact amount of food and ingredients that they need in order to feed its citizens. The fish you were served at the local restaurant was caught in the Pacific Ocean by a company called Tokyo Seafood Inc. It was then sold to Global Fish Distributors, who transported it by air to Paris. Upon arrival, the fish was delivered to a local wholesaler, from whom the restaurant purchased it and prepared it for your meal. This seamless supply chain ensures Paris is always well-fed.

This process works because of the market system, where each person, from fishermen to wholesalers, acts in their own best interest but ends up helping everyone. Fishermen sell their catch for the best price, distributors and transporters handle logistics to make a profit, and wholesalers manage stock to meet demand. Prices act as signals, indicating scarcity or abundance, and guiding decisions on where resources are needed most. [(2)](#2) This decentralized decision-making, driven by incentives and coordinated by prices, ensures that even a city as large as Paris receives the right amount of food and ingredients every day, without a central planner orchestrating the process.

By selfish, I mean we all act in a way to be happier (as well off as possible), and we all get there differently. Some people are happier when they help someone cross the street, or volunteer somewhere. These things have value as well, even if not monetary. This is the concept of utility in economics: the total satisfaction or benefit derived from consuming a good or service.
