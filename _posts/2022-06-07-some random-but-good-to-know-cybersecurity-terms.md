### What is IPS, and what is WAF? And how are they different

An IPS is an intrusion prevention system, a WAF is a web application firewall.

An IPS is a more broadly focused security product. It is typically signature and policy basedâ€”meaning it can check for well-known vulnerabilities and attack vectors based on a signature database and established policies. The IPS establishes a standard based off the database and policies, then sends alerts when any traffic deviates from the standard. The signatures and policies grow over time as new vulnerabilities are known. In general, IPS protects traffic across a range of protocol types such as DNS, SMTP, TELNET, RDP, SSH, and FTP. IPS typically operates and protects layers 3 and 4. The network and session layers although some may offer limited protection at the application layer (layer 7).

A web application firewall (WAF) protects the application layer and is specifically designed to analyze each HTTP/S request at the application layer. It is typically user, session, and application aware, cognizant of the web apps behind it and what services they offer. Because of this, you can think of a WAF as the intermediary between the user and the app itself, analyzing all communications before they reach the app or the user. Traditional WAFs ensure only allowed actions (based on security policy) can be performed. For many organizations, WAFs are a trusted, first line of defense for applications, especially to protect against the
