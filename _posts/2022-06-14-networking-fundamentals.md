In order for two computers to communicate, they  must somehow be connected to each other. Today, we take it for granted that I can buy a Lenovo laptop, and it has the ability to join the internet and communicate with your Asus PC right out of the box. Lenovo and Asus don't have a special partnership in order to make this happen. All they have to do is build their devices such that they follow world-wide accepted protocols for communucation.

### Some history

Once upon a time (1960's), two devices made by two different companies could not talk to eachother. There was no standard way to communicate between networks, operating systems, and computers. IBM was working on their own proprietary network design and OS, allowing an IBM machine to only talk to another IBM machine. Note that packet switching was starting to become a prevailent idea [(1)], just missing the step from theoretical to practical in order to combat the older circuit switching technology.

The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) recognized this problem, and created a template/model called (somewhat confusingly) the Open Systems Interconnect (OSI). The OSI model is simply a guide and didn't explain the "how". 

As it turned out, the OSI model wasn't the only model proposed during the period. The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) was also developing its own communication protocol, now known as the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol suite, or TCP/IP [(2)]. While OSI was just a model, TCP/IP 

This led to what is known today as the ["protocol wars"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protocol_Wars)

### Notes:

### 1 
While the circuit switching infrastructure was already in place thanks to the telephone lines,  it really wasn't clear how to build a packet switching system. Packet switching basically entails sending a message in parts, through potentially different routes, and reassembling that message in the correct order at the destination. This technology has numerous benefits over the old technology, some of which are enabling the more efficient use of existing communication channels and being faster. On the other hand, circuit switching used a dedicated communication line between two parties. This meant that the entire channel was busy, even if it wasn't being used to its full capacity by the two parties.

Interesting how so many (if not all) major technological advancements have originated in the defence sector.
