In order for two computers to communicate, they  must somehow be connected to each other. Today, we take it for granted that I can buy a Lenovo laptop, and it has the ability to join the internet and communicate with your Asus PC right out of the box. Lenovo and Asus don't have a special partnership in order to make this happen. All they have to do is build their devices such that they will follow world-wide accepted protocols for communucation.

### Some history

Once upon a time (1960's), two devices made by two different companies could not talk to eachother. There was no standard way to communicate between networks, operating systems, and computers. IBM was working on their own proprietary network design, allowing one IBM mahcine to talk to another, while 

The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) recognized this problem, and created a template/model called (somewhat confusingly) the Open Systems Interconnect (OSI). The OSI model is simply a guide and didn't explain the "how". 

As it turned out, the OSI model wasn't the only model proposed during the period. The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) was also developing its own communication protocol, now known as the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol suite, or TCP/IP. 

This led to what is known today as the ["protocol wars"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protocol_Wars)
