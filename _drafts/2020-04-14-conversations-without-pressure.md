I wrote the following in around the middle of October 2019. For some context: at that time, Turkey had just launched a military operation on a part of Syria which was mostly occupied by the Kurds. 

"I was at Tim Hortons the other day, and I noticed something. The man in his 40-50s next to me was on CNN reading about the situation on Kurds, and I 
heard another group of guys speaking in their native tongue (African), and I would hear names of different countries, and then I heard a group of 
mostly brown people mention Pakistan. I think once a country reaches a certain point of prosperity, and once  people live alright, then they can afford to think about politics. It's an easy topic reachable to anyone because nobody actually knows the truth, and speculating is fun. Just like girls like to gossip, guys like to talk about politics. There are no prerequisites to talk about politics. No barrier for entry, You know your nouns and verbs, right this way sir! Now obviously if you have knowledge in economics/polisci/history/sociology/etc, you will be able to come up with better conclusions, but these will be speculations nonetheless. None of us can know what's up there. Who are the big boys in this game. This stuff is way too complex, and is likely hidden from the average person. It takes years of studies and maturity in the field to better understand it. To not have a degree in any of the these fields and to say "if I was minister, I'd do this this and this", is in my opinion disrespectful to the people who are actually knowledgeable.
