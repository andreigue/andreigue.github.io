I must first say that I think that if two people follow the same exact diet, they may have different results. I also believe that different people can be optimally healthy on different diets. Anything involving humans is complicated and hard to fully understand. Psychology, economics, business and health are all examples. 

I believe that people can be healthy on a vegan diet, on a paleo diet, on a carnivore diet, etc. Whoever says otherwise, is 100% biased. Maybe they heard a story (or 10 of them) of a young girl who "wanted to do good for the world and stopped eating animals in order to save the planet, but got sick after a month, or a year, of going vegan". You can also get injured from running, sure, that doesn't mean that running is inherently bad.
