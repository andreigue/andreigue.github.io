I think it was in Jauary (2023) that Jerome Powell, fed chairman, was tricked by russian "pranksters" that he is in a video call with Ukranian President Zelenksyy. The video has been leaked and here is something that Powell said:

_"Growth in 2022 was positive but modest; it was subdued, around one percent. In terms of this year, most forecasts call for the US economy to continue to grow but at a pretty subdued level. So growth of less than 1% let's say. But we would tell you that a recession is almost as likely as very slow growth. [...] I think that is partly because of us having raised rates quite a bit, but this is what it takes to get inflation down. We've had inflation at its highest level in 40 years. To get inflation to come down, we need a period of slower growth so that the economy can cool down,so the labor market can cool off, so that wages can cool off. And so that's how inflation comes down. Thats's the only way we know to bring inflation down. And it can be painful, but we don't know of any painless way for inflation to come down"._

My question when hearing this was "you are fighting inflation now, great, thank you, but weren't you the one to start this problem in the first place?".

So in this article, I'd like to explore the fed's workings. When, what, how, who, why.
