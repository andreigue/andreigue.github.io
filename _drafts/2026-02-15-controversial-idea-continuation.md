I wrote this article with a liberal/progressive person in mind (not any specific one). A person who value signals, i.e.
Someone with "correct opinions". "Be kind to one another". I had in mind environments where consensus is enforced through social pressure, reputational risk, and moral language. 

I guess I wrote this article with the progressive/liberal/"big-city thinking" in mind. I was thinking about people who value signal. In an extreme case, think of a multinational corporation which sees that LGBTQ movements are popular, and so they join the parade as a corporation. I doubt the CEO or anyone at the highest levels care about gay people. But ... .

Rejecting mainstream consensus is not the same as thinking independently. 

I guess I chose the wording for this article maybe for some "poignant" effect, but the point is not that every independent thinker must and will absolutely have at least one controversial opinion. No. But...

A non-independent thinker will have no controversial opinions.

How I think, is I have a few fundamental beliefs, and then build off the rest of the pyramid on top. 

Q: does it not make sense for many people, given that they have the same fundamental beliefs, come to the same conclusions on many topics. For example, if i think that everyone should have the right to do whatever they want with their bodies, then it makes sense (maybe gotta also consider other factors? other fundamental beliefs?) that i be pro-choice, and support gender transitioning operations (or wtv thats called). What else would I support?
what about a religious person? are they more likely to be conservative? why?
