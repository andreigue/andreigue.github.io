I"­<p>Iâ€™m a third year software engineering student, seeking an internship for Summer 2020. The ideal internship for me would be any technical position, as I am at a point in my learning journey where I just want to learn anything and everything about software.</p>

<p>Feel free to check out my projects, check out my blog posts, contact me, stalk me, I donâ€™t care. Do whatever you want, just donâ€™t DDoS me or something.</p>
