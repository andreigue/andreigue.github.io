I"‡<p>Hereâ€™s the situation. Weâ€™re in the 1590â€™s, in the Dutch Republic, aka the United Provinces (modern day Netherlands). Since the 1550â€™s, tulips had first been introduced into Europe from Turkey (they grow in many regions in Central Asia, but it became popular in Turkey in the 1500â€™s).</p>

These were some of the most beautiful flowers that the Europeans had ever seen.</p>

<p>So for 40 years, these beautiful flowers were only possessed by the rich. They would plant them in their gardens to demonstrate their wealth. However, the arrival of these flowers also coincided with The Netherlandsâ€™ independence from Spain (which happened in 1582, and which was mainly due to their invention of an early form of capitalism), after which the country prospered economically in a period called the Dutch Golden Age (which roughly spanned the 17th century) <a href="#1">(1)</a>. The middle class in the country was growing in size, and the flower naturally became a status symbol (itâ€™s something the rich already possessed, and so if you want to seem rich, nowâ€™s your chance). These people were willing to pay a lot just to get their hands on the newest, the latest, and the most spectacular-looking tulips (consumption/materialism basically).</p>

<p>One day, some dutch (actually Flemish, but same thing) botanist planted a bunch of tulip bulbs (seeds) in his garden, and noticed that these flowers could survive in the harsh conditions of the Netherlands.</p>

<p>These flowers were touched by a disease which would change their color. This caused the petals to display flame-like multicolored stripes.</p>
