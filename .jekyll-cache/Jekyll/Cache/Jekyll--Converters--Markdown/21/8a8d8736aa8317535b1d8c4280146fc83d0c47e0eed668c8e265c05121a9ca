I"²<p>Letâ€™s start with the man behind SpaceX, Elon Musk. In 1995, at the age of 28, he co-founded a software company called Zip2 and sold it for $340M 4 years later. He then founded X.com, a banking website, which then turned into PayPal and was sold to eBay in 2002 for $1.5B. Musk owned 11.7% of PayPal, and so he earned $165M. That same year, with $100M under his belt to be invested in an aerospace company, he created SpaceX (or â€œSpace Exploration Technologyâ€). Muskâ€™s ultimate goal with this it is to make humans an interplanetary species. That doesnâ€™t just mean leaving our footprints on Mars; it means to colonize it. The man has some strong ambitions thatâ€™s for sure.</p>
