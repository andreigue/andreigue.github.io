I"x<p>Let’s start with the man behind SpaceX, Elon Musk. In 1995, at the age of 28, he co-founded a software company called Zip2 and sold it for $340M 4 years later. He then founded X.com, a banking website, which then turned into PayPal and was sold to eBay in 2002 for $1.5B. Musk owned 11.7% of PayPal, and so he earned $165M. That same year, with $100M under his belt to be invested in an aerospace company, he created SpaceX (or “Space Exploration Technology”). Musk’s ultimate goal with this it is to make humans an interplanetary species. That doesn’t just mean leaving our footprints on Mars; it means to colonize it. The man has some strong ambitions that’s for sure.</p>
