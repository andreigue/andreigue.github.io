I"<p>The tallest tree in the world is the redwood tree located in the state of California. They can grow to be over a hundred meters tall. But why are they so tall? And how tall can they grow?</p>

<p>Trees have two main opposing forces pulling them towards each other. First, trees need natural resources from the ground below them (water, nitrogen, phosphorus, etc). The shorter the tree is, the easier it is for those resources to reach the top of the tree. However, trees also need sunlight, and competition can be serious at times between neighboring trees. These trees, for example, found in Anza-Borrego Desert State Park in California have blocked so much sunlight that even if there is enough resources provided by the soil, another tree will not be able to grow.</p>
