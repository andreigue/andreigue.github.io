I"ô<p>I am a recent graduate of McGill University with a Bachelors in Software Engineering, currently working at <a href="https://www.kidcoder.ca/">KidCoder</a>, an online school teaching novice programmers (predominantly kids) the Python programming language through Minecraft. Because of itâ€™s part-time nature, I am still open to a position in the IT/programming field. The ideal position for me would be any entry-level technical position within the field of cybersecurity, as I am at a point in my learning journey where I just want to learn anything and everything about the field. I simply want to get my feet wet.</p>

<p>Feel free to check out my blog posts, contact me, stalk meâ€¦ ok donâ€™t stalk, thatâ€™s weird. And no DDoS attacks please.</p>
