I"³<h1 id="welcome-to-my-blog">Welcome to my Blog!</h1>
<p>This is where Iâ€™ll be constantly posting about topics which interest me. This is an attempt to improve my lifestyle and to ensure that I keep learning.</p>

<p>Here I cover topics in multiple fields, including but not limited to business, health, psychology, economics, technology and history. Most blogs typically focus on one central subject, but I couldnâ€™t do that. There are way too many interesting fields for me to limit myself. Iâ€™m sure a lot of people can relate!</p>

<p>If you want to learn about something in specific, this is not the website for you. This is simply a record of my own learning experience. That said, anyone is welcome to wander around and see if anything interests them.</p>
